# SolarVarCACTI

Code for the working paper "Sub-hourly solar variability dependence on time resolution and cloud vertical position", M. Zamora Zapata, J. Kleissl, 2022 (in preparation).
This project tries to link the effects of time resolution and cloud categories to solar variability using the ARM CACTI datasets.
