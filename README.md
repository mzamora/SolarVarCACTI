Code for the paper "Dependence of subhourly solar variability statistics on time interval and cloud vertical position", M. Zamora Zapata, J. Kleissl, Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy, 2022 [Link](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0090846)

This project tries to link the effects of time resolution and cloud categories to solar variability using the open ARM CACTI datasets.
